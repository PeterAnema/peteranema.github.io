# How to work with ... Flutter

## Resources

* [Flutter Home](https://flutter.dev)
* [Building a Puzzle Game - Medium](https://medium.com/quick-code/building-a-puzzle-game-using-flutter-6f629873102d)

## Installation

1. With Homebrew: `$ brew install --cask flutter`
2. Install dependencies: `$ flutter doctor`.  
Typically: Dart, xcode, and IDE plugins.
3. Follow detected decrepencies if required.  
I installed the **Flutter** extension in Visual Studio Code.
